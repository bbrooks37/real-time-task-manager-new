# Paste the content for the Nginx config (from Phase 5, Nginx Configuration File)
# This Nginx config is for the *containerized* Nginx in client/Dockerfile for local testing,
# it is *not* the primary Nginx for the Pi's native setup.
# For now, you can put a very basic config, or if your client/Dockerfile assumes it, include a placeholder.
# For the purpose of getting the Docker build working, a simple Nginx config would be:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
